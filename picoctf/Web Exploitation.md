# 1. Web Gauntlet
> Can you beat the filters?
Log in as admin http://shape-facility.picoctf.net:49293/ http://shape-facility.picoctf.net:49293/filter.php

## Solution:

Is web exploitation domain easy ? or does it just seems like that to me ? Either way Its good that I was able to do it. So hints gave it all The purpose of the challenge was to login as admin without valid credentials that is, So the first thing i did is I opened both of the web one told me which things were filtered and one wa login page itself, I just typed admin and tried to login without password but that wasn't accepted but I got a clue there was SQL script running in background of Login Page I knew we had to modify that to bypass the whole thing, then surfed over the internet to omit over a part of query in sql then I came across different way of commenting ,--,/*etc. so I did my first attempt as `'admin'-- ` vut that didn't work then I carefully studied it again then I came to know taht it should be written as `admin'--` It worked I passed the first round the second round was showing we can't use `--` so what i used `admin'/*` It worked too , The third one did filter use of something more but I don't think it was any different from the previous one I did `admin'/*` and worked again. The round four as different it didn't only limit the symbols but also admin keyword so I had to go through the command list again so i tried every other keyword as administrator but that didn't work so, I understood after somethime we have to admin in such a way that query combines them to make word admin then I used `||` operation to concatenate two of the words, I wrote `ad'||'min'/*` and yohooo It worked even fifth challenge was easy it said to do the same thing as the fourth one but it is just that we can not use UNION but it doesn't matter anyways since I was using || only so I did `'ad'||'min'/*` and with this the challenge ended and when I refreshed the filter page I got the flag.

# 2. SSTI1
> I made a cool website where you can announce whatever you want! Try it out!
I heard templating is a cool and modular way to build web apps! Check out my website here!

## Solution:

I don't know it anymore ... like what.. Is it easy or no ...i don't know. Either ways I found the flag . First of all I checked the hind it was saying Server Side Template Injection literally the full form of SSTI, I searched about and got to know that it is a kind of vulnerability which we can access to get the info we want to , saw a documentation and found out there are different kind of templates used to get the info we need to know which template is being used and before that we'll we have to check whether the vulnerability is there no so we'll use `{{}}` for that (this means evaluate the given). so to check tempelate I ran `{{3*4}}`, `{{2*'4'}}` & `{{2*'q'}}` since it gave me the output for every expression this is Jinja2 so now we know what we have to search about i.e. exploiting SSTI  so after some commands testing it was finally time to get to work First command I used was to execute ID command and get to know what permission does the web application, It indicated that the application has root privileges then the command I used was for listing out the files in the directory we are in. So after the listing files it showed us the files which was present and one of those file was flag, then what we ran the command for reading the file and we got the flag. 

```
{{3*4}}
{{2*'4'}}
{{2*'q'}}
{{ request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('id').read() }}
{{ request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('ls').read() }}
{{ request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('cat flag').read() }}
```
