Decode this message from the moon.

## Solution:

Either I'm getting the hang for Forensics domain or this challenge was easy, It was like what ever I wanted to do in this challenge came to me on its own. This challenge gave me audio file which was nothing but static voice I guess but then I used the first hint which was How did pictures from the moon landing get sent back to Earth? I just googled it and I got the Apollo 11, Apollo 11 used slow-scan television (TV) incompatible with broadcast TV. The next thing I searched was SSTV I came to know we can transmit picture via sound through this then what the only thing I had to do was decoding it then when I searched I decoding SSTV I stumbled upon tools called qsstv and pavucontrol, that website was the one that guided me through thewhole process of decoding SSTV then I opened qstv buit when ever was trying to open pavucontrol from the same terminal it was not possible so I had to use multiple terminal windows then according to steps on the website I'll have to set up a virtual connection in beteen the computer for connecting Pavucontrol and qsstv I dids set that by pactl commans using pulseaudio.There were settings here and there thatneeded some modifications first Pavucontrol - we had to change qsstv connection to virtual in recordings tab and set input and output dev on qsstv enable auto and Auto slant(still don't know what it does). Then I played the audio using paplay. It started generating the image and in the end we got the whole image on which the flag was written. In the end I searched the CMU mascot I came to know that it was sstv type but qsstv auto detected it so there was no need of it.

```
sudo apt install qsstv && sudo apt install pavucontrol -y
qsstv
qsstv && pauvcontrol
pavucontrol
qsstv && pavucontrol
qsstv
pavucontrol
pactl load-module module-null-sink sink_name=virtual-cable
sudo apt update
sudo apt install pulseaudio-utils
pactl load-module module-null-sink sink_name=virtual-cable
paplay -d virtual-cable message.wav
cd Downloads/
paplay -d virtual-cable message.wav
```
